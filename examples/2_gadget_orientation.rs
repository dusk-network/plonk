//! So in the previous examples we've seen how we can go through the whole
//! process of creating a circuit, then a proof, and then verify it.
//!
//! Now, we will show which is the most optimal way (from our perspective)
//! to work with PLONK and circuits that we want to re-use.
//!
//! On the previous example, we needed a bunch of code just to create a simple
//! `Proof` that wasn't even verified by a different `Composer` (the verifier
//! one).
//!
//! On this example, we will work with the previous circuit using the constraint
//! to `One` as Public Inputs instead of a circuit descriptor.

    // - Compute the result and set it as output wire.
    // - Get the result from the gate computation itself as a `Variable`
    // representing the output wire of the gate.
    // Since we can get it for free and the constraint will be added independently
    // whether the result is or isn't provided, then we will choose the second
    // option.

    // As the `add` function states, we are indeed adding the following constraint:
    // `Forces q_l * w_l + q_r * w_r + q_c + PI = w_o (computed by the gate).`

        // q_l , w_l

        Scalar::zero(),
        // Public Inputs
        Scalar::zero(),
    );

    // We do the same for `C + D`. This time we will use a width-4 gate just to show how we
    // should do it. It's obviously not needed since we only have 2 inputs and 1 output. So
    // with width-3 is enough as we saw in the previous gate.
    let c_plus_d = composer.big_add(

        // zero variables everywhere.

    // Now, time to XOR both results!!
    //
    // We need to be smart here. XOR requires `scalar-bits/2 + 1` gates to be performed within
    // a PLONK circuit.
    //
    // So if we know for example that `A + B & C + D` will never need more than 8 bits for example,
    // we can generate a XOR gate that just does the XOR for 10 bits of both numbers.
    //
    // By doing this, we basically save a lot of gates since a regular `Scalar` has 254 bits which means
    // 128 gates.
    //
    // Anyway, if you're not sure of what you're doing, we recommend to use 254 bits to be sure that
    // you're not missing anything.
    let ab_xor_cd = composer.logic_xor_gate(a_plus_b, c_plus_d, 14usize);

    // Now that we've XOR'ed our values, it's time to check if the result is
    // really what we expect it to be, a boolean value.
    //
    // To check that fact, we can simply call PLONKs' `bool_gate` which will add
    // a constraint in the circuit that checks if the inputed
    // variable is indeed in the range [0,1].
    composer.bool_gate(ab_xor_cd);

    // Finally we just need to check if the XOR is not only a boolean value, but also and
    // specifically is equal to FINAL_RESULT.
    //
    // Using this way, we need to know that it is applying the following constraint:
    // `ab_xor_cd - q_c + PI = 0`. So we need to give the negative sign to the public inputs
    // to then force the gate to do `ab_xor_cd - q_c + (-PI) = 0
    composer.constrain_to_constant(ab_xor_cd, Scalar::zero(), -final_result);

    // Since we have polynomials inside of our Composer that don't have any coeff != 0 such as q_range,
    // we need to add dummy_constraints which allow us to avoid the `PolynomialDegreeZero` error.
    // It's a sanity check for the end-user to call this function at the end of the implementation of
    // his/her circuit.
