    //
    // The indexes are needed to build the `VerifierData` so it won't contain
    // all the constraints of the circuit.
    //
    // However, the composer uses a dense instance of the public inputs to
    // prove statements. This way, it will need to keep the vector of
    // indexes internally so the `VerifierData` can be properly generated.
    //
    // Whenever `Constraint::public` is called and appended to a composer, the
    // composer must include this constraint index into the sparse set of
    // public input indexes.
    //
    // This workaround can be removed only after the composer replaces the
    // internal `Vec<BlsScalar>` of the selectors by a single
    // `Vec<Constraint>`.
