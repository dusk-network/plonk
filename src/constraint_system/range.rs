        // There are now two things to note in terms of padding:
        // 1. (a_{i+1}, a_i) proves that {q_i+1} is a quaternary digit.
        // In order to prove that the first digit is a quad, we need to add a zero accumulator (genesis quad)
        // 2. We need the last gate to contain 1 quad, so the range gate equation is not used on the last gate.
        // This is needed because the range gate equation looks at the fourth for the next gate, which is not guaranteed to pass.
        // We therefore prepend quads until we have 1 quad in the last gate. This will at most add one extra gate.
        //
        // There are two cases to consider:
        // Case 1: If the number of bits used is divisible by 8, then it is also divisible by 4.
        // This means that we can find out how many gates are needed by dividing the number of bits by 8
        // However, since we will always need a genesis quad, it will mean that we will need an another gate to hold the extra quad
        // Example: Take 32 bits. We compute the number of gates to be 32/8 = 4 full gates, we then add 1 because we need the genesis accumulator
        // In this case, we only pad by one quad, which is the genesis quad. Moreover, the genesis quad is the quad that has added the extra gate.
        //
        // Case 2: When the number of bits is not divisible by 8
        // Since the number is not divisible by 4, as in case 1, when we add the genesis quad, we will have more than 1 quad on the last row
        // In this case, the genesis quad, did not add an extra gate. What will add the extra gate, is the padding.
        // We must apply padding in order to ensure the last row has only one quad in on the fourth wire
        // In this case, it is the padding which will add an extra number of gates
        // Example: 34 bits requires 17 quads. We add one for the zeroed out accumulator. To make 18 quads. We can fit all of these quads in 5 gates.
        // 18 % 4 = 2 so on the last row, we will have two quads, which is bad.
        // We must pad the beginning in order to get one quad on the last row
        // We can work out how much we need to pad by the following equation
        // (18+X) % 4 = 1
        // X is 3 , so we pad 3 extra zeroes
        // We now have 21 quads in the system now and 21 / 4 = 5 remainder 1, so we will need 5 full gates and extra gate with 1 quad.
        let pad = 1 + (((num_quads << 1) - num_bits) >> 1);
