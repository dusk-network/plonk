Contained within this module are the notes on 
how the permutation argument is formed.


Permutation argument
==============

Within PLONK, the permutation 
polynomials are used to form 
arugments about the proving 
scheme. 

These arguments are used to 
check samples of elements, 
against the original ones. 
As is noted in other parts
of the docs, there is the 
need for a copy check in 
in SNARK schemes. This is 
crucial in our zk-SNARK
scheme, to ensure the 
correctness of wires as
well as
