This module contains the methodology of how
zk-SNARKS are constructed.

SNARK
=====

Zk-SNARK stands for zero-knowledge 
Succinct Non-Interactive ARgument of
Knowledge. These notes will show an 
abstraction on the construction of 
SNARKs by showing the mathematical 
steps involved. 

The type of SNARK we will focus on
will be one with a pre-processing 
stage. This means that the inputs 
to our SNARK system is an output
of a program.
