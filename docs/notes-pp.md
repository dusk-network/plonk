The notes within this module explain the inner workings
of the permutation polynomial evaluations.


Permutation polynomials
======================

A permutation polynomial is a bijective 
function which describes a permutation, 
of a group of elements. 

The purpose of constructing these 
polynomials is often for analysis,
which is done on a permutated set. 
A permutated set is a different 
linear arrangement of elements. 

The linearity of these is how 
permutations differ from other 
means of selection from a set. 

For example: 

\begin{aligned}
{1,2,3}
\end{aligned}

is a number set which can have 
only six permutations, namely:

\begin{aligned}
{1,2,3}
{3,2,1}
{2,1,3}
{2,3,1}
{1,3,2}
{3,1,2}
\end{aligned}

This example satisfies the two 
main properties which define set
permutations:

1. The number of permutations is at most 
n! for n elements. 

2. The permutation is a bijection onto
itself. 

These basic properties are used in 
the construction of zero knowledge 
proofs. Where the relationships 
between groups is used to prove 
changes in the sets of polynomials.
