## Poseidon Implementation for PLONK 
Warning: WIP
** This repository will contain an implementation of PLONK. This is a pure rust implementation designed by the [dusk](https://dusk.network) team ** 

### PLONK
PLONK is a universal and updateable zk-SNARK proving scheme. Introduced by Ariel Gabizon, Zac Williamson and Oana Ciobotaru; this proof scheme requires a trusted set but one which has an updateable set up which is proved only once for every program. One advantage of PLONK is how multiple parties can participate and more can be added later, with only the requirement that one is honest.  

Roadmap 
- [] Complete preselector polynomial calculation
- []
